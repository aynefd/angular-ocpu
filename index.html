    <h1>OpenCPU AngularJS App Demo</h1>
    <p>
      The sole purpose of these examples is to demonstrate how to use the
      <a href="https://github.com/bbroeksema/angular-ocpu"><tt>angular-ocpu.js</tt></a>
       library to call R from <a href="https://angularjs.org/"><tt>AngularJS</tt></a>
       applications using OpenCPU.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/bbroeksema/angular-ocpu"><tt>angular-ocpu.js</tt></a>
      library depends on
      <a href="https://github.com/bbroeksema/angular-ocpu"><tt>angular-ocpu.js</tt></a>
      and provides a promise based OpenCPU API as the $ocpu service.
      A copy of angular.js and angular-ocpu.js must be included with your OpenCPU app.
    </p>

    <h2>Topics</h2>
    <p>
      Each topic consists of a minimal HTML page demonstrating basic functionality.
